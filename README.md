## About Me
I'm currently learning Full Stack Web Development at the University of Alberta and have been enjoying learning new skills. In my spare time, you'll find me on Discord, playing games, honing my skills on freeCodeCamp, or at the gym.

### Fun Facts
- I really wanted to become a video editor or a 3-D animator, but was unable to pursue that path.
  - I learned to edit and animate videos because of MapleStory (MMORPG game)! I used Sony Vegas Pro 9.0 in those 10 years. I have only recently learned how to use AE and Premiere.
- I have three cats 🐱
