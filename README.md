# Hi there 👋

## About Me
I'm **Clarisse (she/her)**. I'm currently in the Full Stack Web Development program at the University of Alberta. In my spare time, you'll find me on Discord, playing games, or at the gym.

### Fun Facts
- I really wanted to become a video editor or a 3D animator, but I was unable to pursue that path.
  - I learned to edit and animate videos because of MapleStory (MMORPG game)! I used Sony Vegas Pro 9.0 at the time and I only recently learned how to use AE and Premiere.
- I have three cats! 🐱🐱🐱
