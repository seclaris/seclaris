## About Me
I'm currently learning Full Stack Web Development at the University of Alberta and have been enjoying learning new skills. 

I am also using freeCodeCamp to further hone my skills.

### Fun Facts
- I really wanted to become a video editor or a 3-D animator, but was unable to pursue that path.
  - I learned to edit and animate videos because of MapleStory (MMORPG game)!
- I have three cats üê± [Cat Tax](#Cat Tax)
